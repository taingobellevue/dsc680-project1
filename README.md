# DSC680 - Applied Data Science
# First Project - CIFAR100 Image Classification with Deep Learning

## For this project, a deep neural network will be built and trained by using the CIFAR-100 dataset. Different parameters such as the number of convolutional layers, max pooling layers, hidden units in the convolutional layers and optimizers will be tested. The results for the best parameters are shown in the pdf file because GitHub is having issue loading the ipynb file.
